Lucifer's AA introduction
Hi, uh, my name's Lucifer. I wouldn't really say that I'm an alcoholic but I have to be here because I accidentally showed up to work drunk and dropped one of the human souls that was supposed to work for a thousand years into a furnace. I haven't touched a glass of gin since the incident.
